        <h2>Git Commands and their uses</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Git</b> is a version control system which needs to be installed in our machines
            to keep track of the code file changes and later save them on a remote repository
            like Github or Bigbucket.

                concepts</a><br><br>
            Below are the git commands and their corresponding functionalities:
            <br><br>
        <ul>
            <li><b>git init</b></li><br>
            It is used to intialize git to do version control for our project in our working directory.
            <br><br>
            <li><b>git --version</b></li><br>
            It is used to check the git version installed in our system.
            <br><br>
            <li><b>git config --global user.email "you@example.com"</b></li><br>
            It is used to set the user email id which is used as identification while commiting the code.
            <br><br>
            <li><b>git config --global user.name "Your Name"</b></li><br>
            It is used to set the user email id which is used as identification while commiting the code.
            <br><br>
            <li><b>git status</b></li><br>
            It is used to know the sattus of our code files like whether they are untracked,staged or commited.
            <br><br>
            <li><b>git add [filename]</b></li><br>
            It is used to stage the untracked code file. Means the file from the working directory is moved to
            the staging area where this file is held for its changes to be commited to local repository.
            <br><br>
            <li><b>git add .</b></li><br>
            It will add i.e. stage all the code files to the staging area.
            <br><br>
            <li><b>git commit -m "[message]"</b></li><br>
            It is used to commit the staged changes to the local repository with a -m option where the message
            is given to identify the recent changes.
            Basically we are making a log of the changes.
            <br><br>
            <li><b>git log</b></li><br>
            It is used to check the list of commits we have done so far.

            <br><br>
            <li><b>git reset --hard [SHA number]</b></li><br>
            SHA number is the secured hash algorithm number which is unique for each commit. <br>
            It is used to delete the recent commit change and go back to the previous commit working code represented by
            that particulat commits SHA.

            <br><br>
            <li><b>git reset --soft [SHA number]</b></li><br>
            It is used to go back to the previous commited code along with the latest code change still available.The
            git log will only show
            previous commited logs but the recent commited log will not be there even though the change in this commit
            will be still available.
            <br><br>
            <li><b>git remote add origin [url]</b></li><br>
            It is used to set the origin location on remote repository where the code needs to be pushed from local
            repository.
            <br><br>
            <li><b>git branch -M main </b></li><br>
            This sets the branch name as main
            <br><br>
            <li><b>git push -u origin main</b></li><br>
            It is used to push the code from local to remote at the specified URLs origin's main branch .

            <br><br>
            <li><b>git clone url </b></li><br>
            It is used to get the code from remote to local .
            <br><br>
            <li><b>git pull</b></li><br>
            Here u need to go into the folder where the code was cloned and do git pull .
            It is used to get any latest changes which happened on remote

            Actually git pull has two steps in it .. git fetch which fetches the code from remote and git merge which
            merges any new changes to the local .
            <br><br>
            <li><b>git branch </b></li><br>
            It is used to check which are the branches and which is the current branch ..
            <br><br>
            <li><b>git branch [branchname] </b></li><br>
            It is used to create a branch with the mentioned branch name .
            <br><br>
            <li><b>git checkout branchname </b></li><br>
            It is used to check out from current branch and move on to the mentioned branch .
            <br><br>
            <li><b>git merge branchname</b></li><br>
            It is used to merge the new changes done in the mentioned branchname into the current branch.
        </ul>
